                              CALL FOR PAPERS:
                          The First IEEE Workshop on
 Emerging Parallel and Distributed Runtime Systems and Middleware (IPDRM’2016)
                           May 27th, 2016, Chicago

                             Held in conjunction with
 The 30th IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium 
                                 (IPDPS’16)

Node architectures of extreme-scale systems are rapidly increasing in 
complexity. Emerging homogeneous and heterogeneous designs provide massive 
multi-level parallelism, but developing efficient runtime systems and 
middleware that allow applications to efficiently and productively exploit 
these architectures is extremely challenging.  Moreover, current 
state-of-the-art approaches may become unworkable once energy consumption, 
resilience, and data movement constraints are added. The goal of this workshop 
is to attract the international research community to share new and bold ideas 
that will address the challenges of design, implementation, deployment, and 
evaluation of future runtime systems and middleware.   

Scope:

This workshop will emphasize novel, disruptive research ideas over incremental 
advances. We will solicit papers on topics including, but not limited to, the 
following areas:

Runtime System/Middleware Design, Evaluation and Usage 
* Runtime/Middleware for emerging HPC and cloud computing platforms
* Runtime/Middleware for Big Data Computing 
* Modeling and Performance Analysis of Runtime Systems
* Comparison studies of different runtime systems and middleware	
* Tuning and Optimization studies   
* Interactions between Runtime Systems and Middleware  
* Runtime-architecture co-design 

Constraints and Issues for Runtime Systems and Middleware
* Energy- and Power-aware schemes
* Fault Tolerance and Reliability 
* Scalable high-performance I/O and access to Big Data
* Memory management
* Runtime data analysis (e.g., in-situ analysis)
* Real-time solutions and QOS
* Virtualization, provisioning, and scheduling
* Scalability of novel runtime systems and applications using them

Design Principles and Programming Support    
* High-level programming models (e.g., thread and task based models, data 
  parallel models, and stream programming) and domain-specific languages
* Programming frameworks, parallel programming, and design methodologies 
* Methodologies and tools for runtime and middleware design, implementation, 
  verification, and evaluation   
* Wild and crazy ideas on future Runtime System and Middleware 


Paper Submissions:

We invite two kinds of submissions to this workshop: (1) Full-length research 
papers (8-page limit); (2) Short papers (4-page limit), which can take the 
form of position papers, experience reports, or surveys/comparisons of runtime 
systems and middleware. Papers should not exceed eight (or four) single-spaced 
pages (including figures, tables and references) using 10-point font on 
8.5x11-inch pages. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, 
technical strength, significance, presentation quality, and appropriateness. 
Submitted papers should not have appeared in or under consideration for another 
venue. A full peer-review process will be followed with each paper being 
reviewed by at least 3 members of the program committee. 

Submissions will be accepted through the Easychair system at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ipdrm16

Important Dates:

* Full papers (8 pages max):  
* Deadline: Jan. 22nd
* Automatic Extension: Jan. 29th
* Author notification: Feb. 22nd
* Camera-ready copy: Mar. 7th 

* Short papers (4 pages max):
* Deadline: Jan. 29th
* Automatic Extension: Feb.  5th
* Author notification: Feb. 22nd
* Camera-ready copy: Mar. 7th

All dates are AOE ("Anywhere on earth").
