## Overview

Node architectures of extreme-scale systems are rapidly increasing in complexity. Emerging homogeneous and heterogeneous designs provide massive multi-level parallelism, but developing efficient runtime systems and middleware that allow applications to efficiently and productively exploit these architectures is extremely challenging.  Moreover, current state-of-the-art approaches may become unworkable once energy consumption, resilience, and data movement constraints are added. The goal of this workshop is to attract the international research community to share new and bold ideas that will address the challenges of design, implementation, deployment, and evaluation of future runtime systems and middleware.

## Topics

This workshop will emphasize novel, disruptive research ideas over incremental advances. We will solicit papers on topics including, but not limited to, the following areas:

### Runtime System/Middleware Design, Evaluation and Usage
* Runtime/Middleware for emerging HPC and cloud computing platforms
* Runtime/Middleware for Big Data Computing
* Modeling and Performance Analysis of Runtime Systems
* Comparison studies of different runtime systems and middleware
* Tuning and Optimization studies
* Interactions between Runtime Systems and Middleware
* Runtime-architecture co-design

### Constraints and Issues for Runtime Systems and Middleware
* Energy- and Power-aware schemes
* Fault Tolerance and Reliability
* Scalable high-performance I/O and access to Big Data
* Memory management
* Runtime data analysis (e.g., in-situ analysis)
* Real-time solutions and QOS
* Virtualization, provisioning, and scheduling
* Scalability of novel runtime systems and applications using them

### Design Principles and Programming Support
* High-level programming models (e.g., thread and task based models, data parallel models, and stream programming) and domain-specific languages
* Programming frameworks, parallel programming, and design methodologies
* Methodologies and tools for runtime and middleware design, implementation , verification, and evaluation
* Wild and crazy ideas on future Runtime System and Middleware

## Submissions

* Extended Paper Submission: August 15th 2022
* Paper Notification: September 7th, 2022
* Final Paper Due: October 10th, 2022

## Submission Guidelines:

Full submission will be up to 8 pages long using the same format as the SC22
conference (i.e. using the IEEE template). This limit includes all materials
(figures, bibliography, appendixes, etc).  All submitted 
papers will undergo a rigorous review process and each will have at least 
three reviews by members of the program committee. Papers will be accepted 
based on their technical contributions. “Crazy and Wild ideas” are welcome. 
Accepted papers will have quick lighting presentations on the workshop day 
to spark conversation and discussion. Papers can be submitted at 
<a href="https://submissions.supercomputing.org/" target="__blank">SC Submission site</a>

### Keynote

We are proud to annouce Dr. Sunita Chandrasekaran will be presenting our keynote this year.

#### Bio
Sunita Chandrasekaran is an Associate Professor with the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at the University of Delaware, USA. She is also a computational scientist with Brookhaven National Laboratory. She received her Ph.D. in 2012 on Tools and Algorithms for High-Level Algorithm Mapping to FPGAs from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Her research spans High Performance Computing, parallel programming for exascale computing, performance benchmarking and machine learning. She is currently the PI for ECP SOLLVE and OLCF CAAR PIConGPU project. She is also the co-director of a new AI Center of Excellence (AICoE) at UDEL. She is a recipient of the 2016 IEEE-CS TCHPC Award for Excellence for Early Career Researchers in High Performance Computing.

#### Title
Challenges and success stories migrating software and applications to Frontier

#### Abstract 
This talk will share stories from CAAR PIConGPU and ECP SOLLVE projects. The stories will present our experiences on porting applications to pre-exascale systems to exascale system, Frontier. It will highlight challenges we faced preparing and using relevant software tools including alpaka, OpenMP and OpenACC programming models among other tools. The talk will also present insights we gathered from profiler/performance analysis tools. Takeaways will be drawn from both the projects to share with the IPDRM community and at the same seek input from the audience so we can together improve our techniques and approaches.
