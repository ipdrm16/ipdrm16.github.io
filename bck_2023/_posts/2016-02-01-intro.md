## Overview

The role of runtime and middleware has evolved over the past several years as we have begun the exascale era.  For leadership class machines, advanced runtime technology not only plays an important role in task scheduling and management but also has gained prominence in providing consistent memory across accelerator architectures, intelligent network routing, and performance portability, among other properties.  With diminishing returns from hardware fabrication technology, clusters are beginning to include more specialized accelerators such as FPGAs, CGRAs, and custom ASICs.  For popular domains such as machine learning, we have observed the return of the stand-alone appliance -- i.e., highly specialized co-designed software/hardware products sold as black box units that are efficient at solving a popular (although narrow) problem space.  These platforms highlight middleware challenges such as task and data management while adding new opportunities for the exploitation of application-specific engines.  Further, advances in fields such as AI/ML provide new and exciting opportunities for guiding and exploiting the hardware/software substrate.  This workshop aims to attract the international research community to share new and bold ideas that will address the challenges of design, implementation, and evaluation of future runtime systems and middleware.


This year, we will have a special emphasis on middleware that connects AI/ML to HPC systems.  There are several challenges associated with the support of complex AI workflows leveraging heterogeneous compute and memory resources.  For example, many challenges in the interaction between Python-based distributed deep learning frameworks and the underlying hardware and the implications for memory and communication management.

#### Title
DeepSpeed4Science: Enabling Future Large-Scale Scientific Discovery through Sophisticated AI System Technologies

<!--
#### Abstract 
This talk will share stories from CAAR PIConGPU and ECP SOLLVE projects. The stories will present our experiences on porting applications to pre-exascale systems to exascale system, Frontier. It will highlight challenges we faced preparing and using relevant software tools including alpaka, OpenMP and OpenACC programming models among other tools. The talk will also present insights we gathered from profiler/performance analysis tools. Takeaways will be drawn from both the projects to share with the IPDRM community and at the same seek input from the audience so we can together improve our techniques and approaches.

#### Title
HPC Software Scaling for ML Using CXL 3.0 GFAM

#### Abstract

Traditional HPC systems rely on balanced soft scaling, which adjusts the compute-to-memory ratio according to the workload. However, this approach is challenged by Machine Learning applications, especially Large Language Model (LLM) workloads, which demand much more memory than compute. This leads to wasted compute resources and excessive data movement in the system. To address this issue, we propose to use CXL 3.0 Global Fabric Attached Memory (GFAM), which enables independent scaling of compute and memory and reduces data movement. In this talk, we will explore how GFAM architectures require changes in memory and compute placement, as well as software stacks, to optimize performance for LLM workloads.

#### Title
Enabling Large Dynamic Neural Network Training with Learning-Based Runtime Memory Management

#### Abstract

Dynamic neural network (DyNN) enables high computational efficiency and strong representation capability. However, training DyNN can face a memory capacity problem because of increasing model size or limited GPU memory capacity. Managing tensors to save GPU memory is challenging, because of the dynamic structure of DyNN. We introduce DyNN-Offload, a memory-management runtime system to train DyNN. DyNN-Offload uses a learned approach (using a neural network called the pilot model) to increase predictability of tensor accesses to facilitate memory
 management. The key of DyNN-Offload is to enable fast inference of the pilot model in order to reduce its performance overhead, while providing high inference (or prediction) accuracy. DyNN-Offload reduces input feature space and model complexity of the pilot model based on a new representation of DyNN. DyNN-Offload enables 8x larger DyNN training on a single GPU compared with using PyTorch alone (unprecedented with any existing solution). Evaluating with AlphaFold (a production-level, large-scale DyNN), we show that DyNN-Offload outperforms unified virtual memory (UVM) and dynamic tensor rematerialization (DTR), the most advanced solutions to save GPU memory for DyNN, by 3x and 2.1x respectively in terms of maximum batch size.
