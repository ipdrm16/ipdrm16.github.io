## Overview

The role of runtime and middleware has evolved over the past several years as we have begun the exascale era.  For leadership class machines, advanced runtime technology not only plays an important role in task scheduling and management but also has gained prominence in providing consistent memory across accelerator architectures, intelligent network routing, and performance portability, among other properties.  With diminishing returns from hardware fabrication technology, clusters are beginning to include more specialized accelerators such as FPGAs, CGRAs, and custom ASICs.  For popular domains such as machine learning, we have observed the return of the stand-alone appliance -- i.e., highly specialized co-designed software/hardware products sold as black box units that are efficient at solving a popular (although narrow) problem space.  These platforms highlight middleware challenges such as task and data management while adding new opportunities for the exploitation of application-specific engines.  Further, advances in fields such as AI/ML provide new and exciting opportunities for guiding and exploiting the hardware/software substrate.  This workshop aims to attract the international research community to share new and bold ideas that will address the challenges of design, implementation, and evaluation of future runtime systems and middleware.


This year, we will have a special emphasis on middleware that connects AI/ML to HPC systems.  There are several challenges associated with the support of complex AI workflows leveraging heterogeneous compute and memory resources.  For example, many challenges in the interaction between Python-based distributed deep learning frameworks and the underlying hardware and the implications for memory and communication management.

## Topics

This workshop will emphasize novel, disruptive research ideas over incremental advances. We will solicit papers on topics including, but not limited to, the following areas:

### Runtime System/Middleware Techniques. Design, and Evaluation
* Runtime/Middleware for exascale/large scale computing
* Runtime/Middleware for accelerators or appliances
* Network and I/O middleware technology
* Modeling and Performance Analysis of Runtime Systems
* Interactions between runtime and middleware
* Runtime-architecture co-design
* Tuning and optimization studies
* Workflow/application-centric challenges and solutions for runtime systems

### Constraints and Issues for Runtime Systems and Middleware
* Energy- and Power-aware schemes
* Fault Tolerance and Reliability
* Heterogenous resource management 
* Data movement
* Memory models
* Scalability

### Design Principles and Programming Support
* High-level programming models (e.g., thread and task based models, data parallel models, and stream programming) and domain-specific languages
* Programming frameworks, parallel programming, and design methodologies
* Methodologies and tools for runtime and middleware design, implementation , verification, and evaluation
* Wild and crazy ideas on future Runtime System and Middleware

## Submissions

* Extended Paper Submission: August 11th 2023
* Paper Notification: September 1st, 2023
* Final Paper Due: September 22th, 2023

## Submission Guidelines:

Full submission will be up to 8 pages long using the same format as the SC23
conference (i.e. using the<a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template" target="blank"> ACM conference template</a>). This limit includes all materials
(figures, bibliography, appendixes, etc).  All submitted 
papers will undergo a rigorous review process and each will have at least 
three reviews by members of the program committee. Papers will be accepted 
based on their technical contributions. “Crazy and Wild ideas” are welcome. 
Accepted papers will have quick lighting presentations on the workshop day 
to spark conversation and discussion. Papers can be submitted at 
<a href="https://submissions.supercomputing.org/" target="__blank">SC Submission site</a>

### Keynote

We are proud to annouce Dr. Sunita Chandrasekaran will be presenting our keynote this year.

#### Bio
Sunita Chandrasekaran is an Associate Professor with the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at the University of Delaware, USA. She is also a computational scientist with Brookhaven National Laboratory. She received her Ph.D. in 2012 on Tools and Algorithms for High-Level Algorithm Mapping to FPGAs from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Her research spans High Performance Computing, parallel programming for exascale computing, performance benchmarking and machine learning. She is currently the PI for ECP SOLLVE and OLCF CAAR PIConGPU project. She is also the co-director of a new AI Center of Excellence (AICoE) at UDEL. She is a recipient of the 2016 IEEE-CS TCHPC Award for Excellence for Early Career Researchers in High Performance Computing.

#### Title
Challenges and success stories migrating software and applications to Frontier

#### Abstract 
This talk will share stories from CAAR PIConGPU and ECP SOLLVE projects. The stories will present our experiences on porting applications to pre-exascale systems to exascale system, Frontier. It will highlight challenges we faced preparing and using relevant software tools including alpaka, OpenMP and OpenACC programming models among other tools. The talk will also present insights we gathered from profiler/performance analysis tools. Takeaways will be drawn from both the projects to share with the IPDRM community and at the same seek input from the audience so we can together improve our techniques and approaches.
