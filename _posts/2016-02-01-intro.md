## Overview
<p>The dawn of the exascale era has ushered in unprecedented complexity in high-performance computing (HPC) systems, characterized by extreme parallelism spread across heterogeneous architectures with intricate memory hierarchies. In this landscape, runtime systems and middleware are essential, playing a crucial role in managing these complexities by dynamically managing resources, orchestrating data movement, and facilitating computation, thereby enabling programmers to harness the full potential of these intricate architectures.</P>

<p>This year, IPDRM will emphasize the system software that bridges classical node architectures with increasingly prevalent non-traditional computing paradigms. The heterogeneous hardware landscape is expanding to include post-Moore's Law compute technologies such as quantum, neuromorphic, and analog computing. This workshop seeks contributions that explore novel approaches to middleware and runtime systems that can effectively integrate and manage these diverse computing resources. </p> 

<p> The IPDRM workshop builds on a strong tradition of promoting discussions about advanced runtime and middleware technologies. We aim to attract a diverse group of international researchers. We invite you to share your innovative ideas and solutions that tackle the evolving challenges in designing, implementing, and evaluating future runtime systems and middleware. </p>

## Topics

This workshop will emphasize novel, disruptive research ideas over incremental advances. We will solicit papers on topics including, but not limited to, the following areas:

### Runtime System/Middleware Techniques. Design, and Evaluation
* System software for post-Moore's law (e.g., Quantum, neuromorphic, or analog computing)
* Runtime/middleware for large-scale computing, accelerators, or appliances 
* Network and IO middleware technology 
* Modeling and performance analysis of runtime systems 
* Runtime-architecture co-design 

### Constraints and Issues for Runtime Systems and Middleware
* Heterogeneous resource management 
* Data movement 
* Memory models 

### Design Principles and Programming Support
* High-level programming models (e.g., thread and task based models, data parallel models, and stream programming) and domain-specific languages
* Programming frameworks, parallel programming, and design methodologies
* Methodologies and tools for runtime and middleware design, implementation , verification, and evaluation

## Submissions

* Paper Submission: August 8, 2025
* Paper Notification: September 8, 2025
* Final Paper Due: September 22, 2025

## Submission Guidelines:

Full submission will be up to 8 pages long using the same format as the SC25
conference (i.e. using the<a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template" target="blank"> ACM conference template</a>). This limit includes all materials
(figures, bibliography, appendixes, etc).  All submitted 
papers will undergo a rigorous review process and each will have at least 
three reviews by members of the program committee. Papers will be accepted 
based on their technical contributions. “Crazy and Wild ideas” are welcome. 
Accepted papers will have quick lighting presentations on the workshop day 
to spark conversation and discussion. Papers can be submitted at 
<a href="https://submissions.supercomputing.org/" target="__blank">SC Submission site</a>

<!--
## Instructions for the Virtual Workshop

IPDRM will be hybrid this year. For all the accepted papers, instructions on how to setup your presentations are provided in this [file](SC20_Virtual_Presenter_Packet.zip). For attendees, the login information will be availble near the day of the workshop.

#### Abstract 
This talk will share stories from CAAR PIConGPU and ECP SOLLVE projects. The stories will present our experiences on porting applications to pre-exascale systems to exascale system, Frontier. It will highlight challenges we faced preparing and using relevant software tools including alpaka, OpenMP and OpenACC programming models among other tools. The talk will also present insights we gathered from profiler/performance analysis tools. Takeaways will be drawn from both the projects to share with the IPDRM community and at the same seek input from the audience so we can together improve our techniques and approaches.
