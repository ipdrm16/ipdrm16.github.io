This workshop will emphasize novel, disruptive research ideas over incremental advances. We will solicit papers on topics including, but not limited to, the following areas:

* Runtime System/Middleware Design, Evaluation and Usage 
** Runtime/Middleware for emerging HPC and cloud computing platforms
** Runtime/Middleware for Big Data Computing 
** Modeling and Performance Analysis of Runtime Systems
** Comparison studies of different runtime systems and middleware	
** Tuning and Optimization studies   
** Interactions between Runtime Systems and Middleware  
** Runtime-architecture co-design 

* Constraints and Issues for Runtime Systems and Middleware
** Energy- and Power-aware schemes
** Fault Tolerance and Reliability 
** Scalable high-performance I/O and access to Big Data
** Memory management
** Runtime data analysis (e.g., in-situ analysis)
** Real-time solutions and QOS
** Virtualization, provisioning, and scheduling
** Scalability of novel runtime systems and applications using them

* Design Principles and Programming Support    
** High-level programming models (e.g., thread and task based models, data parallel models, and stream programming) and domain-specific languages
** Programming frameworks, parallel programming, and design methodologies 
** Methodologies and tools for runtime and middleware design, implementation , verification, and evaluation   
** Wild and crazy ideas on future Runtime System and Middleware
